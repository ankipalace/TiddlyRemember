TiddlyRemember configuration is found in two places, in Anki and in your wiki(s).

*  [[Add-on configuration|Configuring the Anki add-on]] within Anki is used to list the wikis you want to sync to your Anki collection. You have to set up the add-on configuration before you can sync anything.
* [[Mapping tiddlers]] within your wiki(s) are used to determine what decks and tags your notes will have in Anki. Mapping tiddlers are entirely optional -- if you don't need different decks and tags in Anki, just ignore them.
