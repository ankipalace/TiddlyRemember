* Cloze note type.
* Automatically create the note type if it doesn't exist, a la LPCG.
* Add some kind of mechanism for choosing decks and/or tags. Perhaps base it on
  the tag or tiddler that the item itself is in -- maybe a set of filters like
  the file placement ditty in NodeJS? The challenge is figuring out if this should
  happen just initially, or repeatedly sync...it would probably be nice to be able
  to move/tag stuff in Anki, but then it wouldn't stay up to date with TW. Thinking
  probably repeatedly, stubbornly move.
* Support multiple wikis.

Single-file test:
{
    "defaultDeck": "tw",
    "tiddlywikiBinary": "/home/soren/cabinet/Me/Records/zettelkasten/node_modules/.bin/tiddlywiki",
    "wiki": {
        "contentFilter": "[type[text/vnd.tiddlywiki]] [type[]] +[!is[system]]",
        "path": "/home/soren/cabinet/Me/Config/oldapps/TiddlyWiki/zettelkasten_static/zettel.html",
        "type": "file"
    }
}
